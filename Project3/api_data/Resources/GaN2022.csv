Slight breaks in clouds where you can see the slightly lighter coloured sky.  You can see the light from helicopters flying South to South West so thin clouds.  Clouds are moving so there are breaks in cloud cover  Can sometimes see a few stars but this changes as clouds move.  I can see some stars South-West I couldn't 10 minutes ago. After another 20 minutes I can no longer see these stars.,Rural village about 30 minutes away from oxford  I'm in my backyard so there is some light pollution from windows nearby.

The clouds were moving a lot faster than the night before as the night before they were mostly still and slightly moving. Though they were moving faster, there were more clouds which blocked a lot of what I was trying to see.

The sky is noticeably brighter than it was just a year ago; dimmer stars are no longer seem.  In 2018  I was on the city planning commission and I wrote an upgraded lighting ordinance to replace the old one.  The new ordinance required  fully shielded Phosphor-converted Amber LED's for streets and parking lots.  Darlington would have been the only city on the east coast to require environmentally friendly Amber lighting!  But our new mayor didn't like that idea and totally ignored the lighting ordinance.","Seven-tenths of a mile from the city square in Darlington, SC.
