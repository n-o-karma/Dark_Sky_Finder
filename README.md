ALWAYS REMEMBER TO GIT PULL BEFORE YOU GIT PUSH
#### comments (Hannah) : 
* If you show the moon weather table, run app.py first to open flask server, then open index.html.
* Adam made new logic.js putting together Desiree's and mine. It works very well.
* I'm pushing logic_stay.js. I changed my python code into js file and put some former js code together. It's not that working. I wish I made it complete, but now I'm so tired. And maybe somebody wants to make a code for recommending accomodation based on the dark place's information. It might be a starter. I will work with that code tomorrow.
