<h1>☆ Dark Sky Finder ☆</h1>

We created an interative map you can use to plan your stargazing trip! 
The map allows you to select the state of your choice and will populate makers in the best locations for stargazing, as well as hotels and camping sites nearby. Based on the location you choose you will then be able to see the moon phases and visibliity for optimum viewing.<br />

We used two different libraries to show Moon phases for the next 10 days. <br />


#### comments (Hannah) : 
* If you show the moon weather table, run app.py first to open flask server, then open index.html.
* Adam made new logic.js putting together Desiree's and mine. It works very well.
