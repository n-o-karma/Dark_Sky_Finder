<h1>☆ Dark Sky Finder ☆</h1>

We created an interactive map you can use to plan your stargazing trip! 
The map allows you to select the state of your choice and will populate markers in the best locations for stargazing on a terrain or light source map, as well as hotels and camping sites nearby. Based on the location you choose you will then be able to see the moon phases and visibility for optimum viewing.<br />

We used two different libraries to show Moon phases for the next 10 days. <br />
You can select the date you are planning to go and plan for a time 2 weeks before and after the New Moon. A brighter moon means those objects in visual vicinity become increasingly more difficult to see due to the glow we observe that is the moon reflecting sunlight. We also created a moon and weather table. <br />

You will also see a NELM number with the markers. NELM is the Naked-Eye Limiting Magnitude which is the apparent magnitude of the faintest stars can be seen with the naked eye from a specific location on Earth. It measures the darkness of the night sky and the quality of observing conditions. <br />

The Bortle Scale is more commonly used today to estimate the brightness of the night sky. It is a 9-level numeric scale used to describe the darkness of the night sky. Class 1 would be no light pollution at all. The darkest sky. Class 9 would be an  Inner City sky, with very little visibility. Similar to the heat map.<br />

Overall, you want somewhere at least 30 miles from the biggest city, ideally, you’d want it further, where there is very little light pollution, no clouds, fog, moisture, haze, etc. The higher the altitude the better. Check the weather for cloudy conditions, precipitation, and visibility. Plan around the moon phases.<br />

And if you’re really passionate about stargazing you can get a Sky Quality Meter which measures the brightness of the night sky and you can submit that data to Globe at Night. This information will help us better understand our evolving night sky conditions and how we can make changes to enhance the aesthetics of the night sky for viewing pleasure.  

We hope you enjoy our interactive map!<br />

#### comments (Hannah) : 
* If you show the moon weather table, run app.py first to open flask server, then open index.html.
* Adam made new logic.js putting together Desiree's and mine. It works very well.
